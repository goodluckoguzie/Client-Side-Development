# Week 5: JavaScript Arrays, Conditionals & Loops

**Institution:** Ulster University

## 📋 Topics Covered

### 1. Arrays
- What is an array and why we need them
- Creating arrays using `[]` and `new Array()`
- Accessing elements by index (starting from 0)
- Changing and adding items
- Array `.length` property
- Array methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, `unshift()`
- Performance: why push/pop is faster than shift/unshift

### 2. Conditional Statements
- `if` statement and boolean conditions
- `if...else` for two-way decisions
- `if...else if...else` for multiple conditions
- Truthy and falsy values (`0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`)
- `switch` statement for matching values
- The importance of `break` in switch (fall-through behaviour)
- Strict equality (`===`) in switch comparisons

### 3. Loops
- `while` loop — checks condition before each iteration
- `do...while` loop — always runs at least once, checks after
- `for` loop — start, condition, and step in one line
- Looping through arrays with `for`
- `break` — exit a loop early
- `continue` — skip to the next iteration

## 📝 Key Takeaways

- **Arrays** store multiple values in a single variable, accessed by index starting at 0
- **if/else** lets your code make decisions based on conditions
- **switch** compares one value against many possible cases
- **while** loops repeat while a condition is true
- **do...while** always executes at least once
- **for** loops are ideal for counting and iterating through arrays
- **break** exits a loop early; **continue** skips to the next iteration
